(based off of a true story, but I modified the story a bit to make it more chaotic and, with people actually wetting themselves)

I am a guy btw, just letting y‚Äôall know.

I‚Äôm using fake names.

I'm using a fake school name.

Context (I can‚Äôt think of a better word to use): so, like, idk, a month ago probably the toilets at my school got shut down for maintenance. Now, it only went from around 9am to 11:25am, but I‚Äôm gonna modify the story a bit to make it more chaotic, and stuff, so yeah uhhh idk how tf I‚Äôm gonna write this, but, I‚Äôm usually good at pulling stories right out my ass crack with no planning whatsoever.

Side note: this story is in Australia, so yeah, also the story is gonna follow me and my friends (with fake names of course, including for me) i dont think there will be any male wettings but let‚Äôs see what I pull out of my ass. Oh, btw me and all of my friends are male, don‚Äôt expect any wetting from me and my friends, the main characters.

Modifications: I am gonna make it that the toilets are shut down all day for 3 days, it‚Äôs thunderstorming all of that time aswell,. Yes I made a new word for that, get mad idc. Anyway and that‚Äôs pretty much it.

Side note 2: sorry for bad spelling, spelling isn‚Äôt my strongest point.

Side note 3: feed back is appreciated, so, to the 2 people who will read this give feedback please!

Ok now on to this goofy ass story.

Chapter 1: morning. Day 1

I stumble out of bed and I attempt to turn off my shitty pedestal fan (and miss the off button at least 4 times before finally pressing it) I get dressed and I walk out to the kitchen, I check the time and it‚Äôs 6:16 AM. (I usually get up this early.) I walk over to the cupboard and then I get my toe stuck under the cupboard door, I scream the F bomb and then I take my toe out of under the cupboard door, I then get angry at the wall across the house for no apparent reason. 

I then grab the cereal from the cupboard, I go of to the fridge and I grab the milk out, I lousily pour the cereal onto a plate, then I realize I grabbed a mother fucking plate, so grab a bowl, and then I put the cereal from said plate Oi to the bowl, I then fill the rest of the bowl up with more cereal, then I put the milk in, and I go sit down in the second lounge room and I start watching some shit on my iPad. About 2+ hours pass and i bag my lunch and I chuck it into my bag and I go have a shower, and get washed in said shower, and then brush my teeth in the shower.

I get out the shower and I go piss in the toilet, I then get up and go back into the bathroom and look in the mirror for at least 15 minutes and I look at my fat ass and my small head and my tiny pp and I start insulting myself. I then grab my bag, I stuff some hotwheels, my iPad, and a bottle of water into my bag, I then stuff my headphones into my bag too, then for no apparent reason I chuck an empty plastic water bottle with used tissues in it across the house, I then turn on my Xbox and I play some Star Trek online for half an hour. I then walk out to my Nissan navara D40. I start the fucker up, sit there and wait for it to warm up, I then pull out of my drive way and I start driving to school for the day. I put on my favorite music.

Chapter 2: 8:45 AM day 1

I park in the only parking spot left and I get may bad and I hauling my dumb ass up to the office, I go through and I sit my ass down in my chair, and because school doesn‚Äôt officially start until 9AM I start chatting to some of my friends, Saxon, Jaquavious, bozo, youtube shorts kid and philipino Fred. (Fake names, of course cuz like imagine having a friend who‚Äôs actual first name is YouTube shorts kid üíÄ) and we sit down and we start chatting about some goofy shit, then an announcement plays over the speaker. ‚ÄúHello students of squid ward Patrick SpongeBob borgir highschool, just kletting you all know that all toilets and water utilities are out of order at the moment, and might not be working for 3 days.‚Äù Now, I shit you fucking not I saw at least 4 peoples faces go from happy to a look of desperation (no I‚Äôm not lying cuz this is based off of one of my experiences.)

Ok that‚Äôs all for now, if some people like this I might continue it, but this is just a trial so yeah, let me know if this is cool and or you like it please!

By ‚Äúfat ass‚Äù I mean I‚Äôm fat, not I have a big butt, just to clarify.

*001*2023-09-19 05:58

Chapter 3: 9AM day 1

I look around the classroom and I shit you not, 45 fucking seconds after the announcement was made, everyone but my friends and 99% of the other boys were complaining that they needed to pee. In my mind im thinking ‚Äúsomeone fucking tell me how a fucking announcement makes all of the girls in the glass need to piss?‚Äù (This didn‚Äôt happen, only about 5-6 people were complaining about needing to pee in my classroom, in the non modified version anyway.) and now me and my friends are actively thinking of places and or ways that the girls could use, but, we couldn‚Äôt think of shit, and we all don‚Äôt have the ability to talk to women apart from Bozo and YouTube shirts kid.

Chapter 4: 9:45AM day 1

The teacher has left 10 seconds ago, and now everyone is making an agreement, if anyone has an accident today, we never speak of it again. Everyone agreed, unsurprisingly. Everyone started chatting and complaining about needing to pee again. I still have no signs of needing whatsoever and I don‚Äôt need to piss at all and it‚Äôs the situation same with my friends.

Chapter 5: 10:03 AM day 1

Ok, the teacher Mrs cologne has come back from walking around the school and is visibly desperate to pee. Now, I have been in enough situations where a lot of people need to pee, and one person starts bobbing up and down and crossing their legs and stuff, and that makes other people need to pee, eventually everyone who already was desperate is now even more desperate, and I now see that happening across the class. I start to take my mind off of the situation, my mind then does the usual and starts thinking about cars, countries, trucks, what ever, and I‚Äôm then just sitting there, obviously not listening at all with a straight face, lost in my mind while pretty much all of the girls in the class being super desperate.

Chapter 6: 10:30 AM day 1

I have noticed that Mrs cologne has a small but still somewhat noticeable spot on her grey sweatpants. I also noticed that one of the girls, Michelle (no she isn‚Äôt a renamed version of one of my classmates, as will all of the females in this story won‚Äôt be real at all) has a small wet patch on her school shorts (Our school shorts are navy blue) it isn‚Äôt very noticeable at all. I‚Äôm only so good at spotting things because I play forza. A LOT. Of forza, and you need like laser precision to get good laps in. Anyway, so yeah.

*003*2023-09-19 21:37

@Heloctre

Thanks, that really means a lot! I‚Äôm just waiting for part 2 to get approved atm, so there‚Äôs more to read!

*004*2023-09-21 00:19

Ok, back to it again, more of this goofy ahh story.

Chapter 7: 10:32 AM day 1

My mind instantly goes back to thinking about stuff I like and what I‚Äôm gonna do when I get home. I sit there, in my chair thinking about how I could improve my lap times on the Nurburgring nordschelife, the car I use is the race built Chevy cruise with a custom design on it I made myself. (I got inspired by the gran tourismo movie, as I just watched it yesterday in the cinema. Yes the Forza stuff is real lol)

Chapter 8: 10:45 AM day 1

Now, I look around the class room again and I can tell most of the females in the class are still desperate, and all of the males in the class are fucking starving like I am at the moment. Me and my friends start to whisper amongst ourselves as we start to get even more bored and hungry. Mrs cologne starts telling us off for talking in class, she starts saying things that aren‚Äôt true, she then finally stops and I say ‚Äúhey, ya know what, at least I‚Äôm not on the verge of wetting myself hey?‚Äù All of my friends start laughing, Mrs cologne is a bit embarrassed now, and all of the other females in the class are either giving me a death stare, laughing, not reacting, not caring, giving me a side eye or getting ready to lunge at me, but I‚Äôm the biggest guy in the class so that‚Äôs not happening if only one does, I don‚Äôt think I can handle 8 girls though lunging at me and attacking me.

@LimoKim0

Thanks for the feedback! And yes, I would think having the time stamps and having each part of the day is better than having a chapter per time stamp. Btw, to anyone reading, yes the morning part happened irl, apart rom the driving part, I don‚Äôt have a car or my license yet lol.

*007*2023-09-22 12:29

Ok, thanks to @LimoKim0

‚Äôs idea, we are gonna switch to having the day in 5 sections (in school, anyway) morning, recess, noon, lunch, afternoon and 3:15, and possibly evening if I decide to spice things up somewhat (not in an omo way, but more in a natural disaster way) ok, now that that‚Äôs outta the way, let‚Äôs get to the story!

Chapter 9: 11:00 (recess, day 1)

Ok, so, in that 15 minute window of nothing, before recess, Mrs cologne wet herself, Michele also wet herself soon after, but no one really reacted, because at this point someone wetting themselves was kinda inevitable, so we all agreed to just not care whatsoever if someone does end up with wet pants.

Now it‚Äôs 11:00 (finally) and we are all munching and crunching on what ever we brought to school. Bozo has an apple, and a few chocolates for recess, I have some raw 2 minute noodles that I‚Äôm gonna crush up and eat like crushed up chips. (Or CHIPPPAAAYYYHHHHSSSS as I call them, it‚Äôs a running gag in my friend group that I say CHIIPPPAAAYYYHHHHSSSS and not chippies or chips) 5 mandarins (I am the mandarin lord at my school, in IRL as well) some savoys, some of those pudding cups you get from Coles (aussie supermarket) and some Pringles.

Everyone else in my friend group just brought some pringles and fruit. We all go outside and we see lots of people with wet pants or wet patches, meanwhile my friend group is taking this as a chance to do some devious things, we start scaring the fuck out of people, (we only scared people who didn‚Äôt look desperate to pee, we‚Äôre only devious, not monsters) and started just throwing shit around. About 10 minutes in I kick a footy and my shoe goes over the fucking fence, so I have to hop Al the way across the school, to go ask a teacher to let me go out of bounds to grab my shoe, then walk back into the school grounds with my shoe on. Let‚Äôs just say THAT was the funniest thing about the whole day. I‚Äôm pretty sure some people started wetting themselves because of laughter, but that was only noticeable inside because it‚Äôs still fucking thunderstorming, so walking across the whole oval, with only one shoe on, with grassy mud, great.

Recess finally ends, and we all go back inside, everyone is soaked from the top of they‚Äôre shirts to the bottom of they‚Äôre socks, so if someone did wet themselves it wouldn‚Äôt really show on there pants anyway.

Chapter 10: middle 2 hours (noon)

We come back in at 11:30, and we get into some school work for the second time of the day, but Mrs cologne can see that 3 quarters of the class is so focused on not peeing themselves that they can‚Äôt do any work, so she just lets us do nothing if we don‚Äôt want to, so I plug my headphones into my ipad, i turn up the volume and just chill (I still don‚Äôt need to pee whatsoever, I just don‚Äôt want to do any work, which now wasn‚Äôt required to do) so I‚Äôm just sitting there, vibing to my favorite songs (my playlist is so goofy, I have phonk, a sad song, more phonk, Granger smith music, more phonk, sad songs, then more phonk).

Then I notice Michelle‚Äôs best friend, Eliza wetting herself, then across the room, daisy wets herself too. I just shrug it off and keep chillin out, eventually I finally get somewhat relaxed and I keep chillin out and vibing, and just sitting back and relaxing. ‚ÄúIts been soooo long since I have been so what relaxed in school, I‚Äôm ngl‚Äù I say to my friends, and YouTube shirts kid agrees with me. About 1 hour passes and we are back into more break, lunch time.

Chapter 11 1:30 (lunch time)

Coming next part.

*009*2023-09-24 23:33

Chapter 11: 1:30 (lunch time) day 1

Everyone starts eating and talking to each other and what not, then Eliza stands up and starts saying something, like she‚Äôs giving a speech. ‚ÄúI can see almost everyone needing to pee at this point, just let it out. I did that, and it‚Äôs actually feels kinda nice.‚Äù Eliza says in an encouraging voice. ‚ÄúMate üò≠‚Äù I say back, obviously confused because unless we‚Äôre on a cruise where accidents are allowed (yes, that‚Äôs a ‚Äúschool trip on a very special cruise‚Äù reference) ‚Äúlike bro, everyone either has pissed themselves, is about to piss themselves, or still doesn‚Äôt need to go at all, and you say it like everyone is gonna do it tooüò≠‚Äù I say in a slightly weirded out tone.

Chapter 12: 1:40 (rest of lunch, A.K.A outside part of lunch)

We all walk out of the classroom, and I can already see, most if not all of the preps have wet themselves, same situation with the grade 1s and 2s, most of the grade 3s and some of the grade 4s have as well, (our school goes from prep to year 12, that‚Äôs why a there are younger grades in here) and I also walked passed some blonde girl who looked about my age, had shat her pants or was pooping herself as she walked by, then I heard some of the girls at the girls toilets (which are close by to the corridor that I usually sit in) laughing loudly.

So I peeked my head around the corner and saw the girl that just passed me, and some other girls which I assumed were sisters, were laughing and bobbing up and down, all have either pooped or wet their pants.

One girl said ‚ÄúYa know, I kinda don‚Äôt care if I pee or poop myself anymore, I kinda like being able to just let go‚Äù then the others agreed, then the blonde girl said ‚ÄúI need to poop again‚Äù and immediately started pooping herself again. I just walk away and keep wondering what to do. About 30 minutes pass and there‚Äôs around 5 minutes left of lunch, so I got meet up with my friends and we start talking some more, then lunch ends and we go back inside.

2:20 (last hour) day 1

The thunderstorm reappears and this time, with heavier rain, higher winds, lower atmospheric pressure, and with louder thunder and stronger lightning. Mrs cologne keeps teaching, and after about 45 minutes the day ends, and the thunderstorm keeps raging on, and we all go home.

3:15: end of school day on day 1

The teachers have gotten out some gazebos to somewhat give some cover from the storm still raging on, I check the weather on my iPad. And THERE IS A MAJOR FLOOD RISK.

3:35: home again, day 1

*010*2024-04-13 10:20

Should I keep this story going?

*013*2024-05-10 11:13

Ok. It‚Äôs been like 6 months. I‚Äôm bored again and so it‚Äôs time to continue.

Also I think I‚Äôm not gonna go with the flood risk idea, it‚Äôs just gonna be too hard to write.

Again, standing under the gazebos, then the principal says over the loud speaker ‚Äúwe have just checked the weather radio they have issued an advisory to stay inside. So may I ask that all students come inside and wait out the storm together. Thank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell fuck.‚Äù I think to myself, pissed that we are now forced to stay in the grounds, preventing us to go home.

We all walk back inside and the principal, over the loud speaker again says ‚Äúto all students and teachers in possession of a vehicle, you must bring your vehicle into the school grounds to make way for students parents who have made the decision to get their children.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, cool‚Äù I say to myself as I walk through the rain out my navara. I get in, turn the key, it cranks, but not starts, I crank it again, it sputters a bit, but still doesn‚Äôt start. ‚ÄúOk, third times the charm I guess?‚Äù I turn the key a third time and it starts right up.

‚ÄúFck yea, YD reliability right there.‚Äù I say to myself, a little bit of glee in my voice. as one of the popular girls, Sandra, who‚Äôs repeatedly cranking the engine in her pink Mercedes C class gets out. I pull up in front of her and ask her: ‚Äúhey, you need a tow?‚Äù With a smirk on my face. She looks up and sees it‚Äôs me. I can tell she gets annoyed because the guy she bullies a lot it offering to tow her car up the the school driveway into the grounds.

She says, with a slightly defeated tone ‚Äúy- yeah, y-yes please‚Ä¶‚Äù I chuckle at her response. ‚ÄúNot so tough now huh?‚Äù She doesn‚Äôt respond, as expected. I jump out and connect a snatch strap to the front of her car, put it in first gear, 4low and without a sweat, the ‚Äúworst diesel engine ever put in a 4x4‚Äù pulls a 2.5 ton Mercedes up a 30 degree hill, with the added 3 tons from the weight if the nav itself. I smiled at this moment, when I got half way up I put the parking brake on and jumped out and took a photo. I get back in and continue to tow it up, and eventually decide to go to the oval, and park her car in the muddiest part. Just as an added insult to injury.

I might write more soon.
