If you wanted to find Jennifer Mártez on the morning of July 10th, 2019, you could do so by arriving at London Euston at around 10:00AM, just after rush hour. From there, you’d need to get the tube- Northern Line- until you reached Goodge Street station, and emerge onto the intersection between Tottenham Street and Tottenham Court Road. Following the former all the way down to Pearson Square, you could cut through onto Riding House and then, finally, you’d find it: an Artisan coffee shop by the name of Kaffeine, and the kind of place you didn’t step foot in unless you were willing to spend a hefty amount on your ground beans.

Here the seats were wicker, the tables and fittings sleek black. Everyone in the place looked as though they had come directly from a designer clothes shop, all expensive sweaters and scarves and shoes. There wasn’t an unpicked eyebrow in the house. And there, at the back of the room on the highest table, sat the woman herself. She was dressed in purple, a branded blouse over denim jeans. Her skin was tanned several shades darker than its natural colour, as was the dye in her long, painfully straightened hair. An expert’s taste of the caffe latte in front of her would have revealed the almond milk inside in place of regular, and cinnamon was sprinkled across the foam at the top.

She wasn’t waiting long before the woman she was there to meet arrived. Keira Morgan was, at twenty-nine, six years older than Jenny, but she barely looked old enough to buy a drink in America. Her black hair was cut short, except for a fringe that hung so low that it was a miracle she could see beneath it. She’d been representing Jenny for four years now, since the latter got her first big breakthrough on Instagram, although it wasn’t always clear what exactly she did; sometimes Jenny felt like Keira’s main job was to make sure she got her own share of the profits at the end of every month. Today she wore the same thing as always- a fake tan and an even faker smile.

“Hi, sorry I’m late,” she said, bumbling towards the table and taking her seat. She hung her diamond-encrusted purse on the back of the chair before sitting, carrying in one hand a steaming cup of mint tea. “How are we today?”

Jenny smiled and nodded and played along with the facade, but the truth was that these conversations bored her. They’d bored her for several years now, ever since the novelty of being a minor celebrity- or ‘influencer’, if that was the correct term- had worn off in her early twenties.

It was only ever a matter of time before Keira found a way to start talking about what she really wanted to talk about. She’d always ask how Jenny was, but it was nothing but a nicety. Sooner or later they’d get to the point.

“So, ITV called and they said they’re not sure you’re famous enough to be on I’m A Celebrity, but they wanted to know if you’re interested in being a backup? It means you go to the hotel in Australia and wait there in case someone drops out”.

“Uh, sure, whatever,” Jenny said dismissively. Being paid for a holiday down under didn’t sound too bad to her.

“And Zoella’s agent called, he says she’s very sorry, but she doesn’t want to work with you again after last time”.

“That bitch,” said Jenny under her breath. “Okay, what else?”

“Well…” Keira said, sounding delicate, “it’s about those Gucci jeans. You agreed to have the review up on your channel by Wednesday morning, and it’s still not there. The sponsors aren’t happy. What’s up with that, Jenny? You’re not usually late”.

Jenny groaned inwardly. She’d been dreading this coming up. Taking another sip of her coffee, she prepared herself to recite the line she’d been preparing all morning.

“It’s fine. I’m taking care of it”.

“Taking care of what? Can’t you just review the damn jeans?”

“I said it’s fine,” Jenny insisted. She was beginning to get annoyed at Keira’s nosiness.

“Well, we need that video up as soon as possible. Where are the jeans, anyway?”

Jenny looked down.

“Jenny, come on. I know you’re not wearing them, or they would’ve blinded me when I got in the room”.

Still, Jenny said nothing. She didn’t know what to say.

“Jenny… don’t tell me you lost them?”

Jenny shook her head. “I threw them out,” she croaked.

“You what?” Keira looked like she might have an aneurism. “You threw out a pair of Gucci jeans? Those things cost the sponsors twelve-hundred pounds, what the hell were you thinking?”

“It wasn’t my fault, okay?” Jenny whined defensively, sounding like a wounded animal. “I had to throw them out, they were ruined”.

“Ruined how?”

Averting her eyes, Jenny looked in her mind again for another lie. When none came, she tried a different tactic: deflection.

"It doesn't even matter, I called the Gucci people and they won't replace them".

"Well of course they won't, those jeans are worth more than a grand!"

"So? Companies usually replace stuff like that for me!" Jenny complained. She really couldn't see how any of this was her fault.

"Just tell me what happened to the jeans. Maybe I can twist a few arms, get you a new pair, as long as you tell me what happened".

"I don't want to talk about it".

"Jenny, get your shit together. I'm the one who gets in hot water if this review doesn't come out soon, so you'd better at least be straight with me".

Jenny waited, sighed, sipped her coffee again. Keira had her cornered. It was looking like she'd have to try the one thing she rarely did: be honest.

"Okay," she said finally, "I'll tell you. But I have to warn you, this story doesn't paint me in a very good light..."

—————————————————————————————

Keira leaned forward eagerly, her face more than a tad pale. She looked very much like a woman who was trying to figure out what the kid she was supposed to be managing had done to wreck a £1,200 pair of jeans, and was already wondering how she was going to find the money to replace them. Jenny rarely had to worry about the financial side of things- she simply made the content and collected her payslips. It was Keira who suffered when things went wrong.

“Well, come on,” she said, “how bad can it be?”

What she wanted to say was I’ve been clearing up your mess for four years already, but Keira kept that part to herself. Working with unpredictable, self-centred young people, restraint was her specialty. An outburst often seemed sorely tempting, but on a bad day it would lose her a client. There was no point getting worked up now.

“I started making the review on Monday, just like we planned,” started Jenny.

This was surprising news to Keira. She’d assumed that the girl had just been too lazy to start on time, causing the delay. But this reveal only made her more suspicious. A strange thought crossed her mind.

“Is this about Jimmy?” she asked, raising an eyebrow. Jimmy was their video editor, who worked from his home in the south of the city. He did good work, but could be a little too slow for Keira’s liking at times. She’d long since guessed that Jenny had taken a bit of a shine to him, hence why she might be covering for him here. But the girl put that train of thought to bed right away.

“No, Jimmy never even got any footage. I didn’t even get the chance to film anything”.

“What?” Keira could hardly believe what she was hearing at this stage. It was one thing to find out that Jenny had wrecked these incredibly expensive jeans, but the fact that that she hadn’t even recorded the smallest bit of footage with them was another level of serious trouble.

“I was out that day, wearing the jeans, going around town like usual,” explained Jenny. “I only go out for a few hours, usually, just to see how they are”.

“How they are?”

“Yeah, how they are,” Jenny snapped, “you know… are they comfy? Do they draw attention? Stuff like that”.

“Okay, I can follow that bit,” Keira said, “but how did you manage to wreck the jeans? It’s London, for God’s sake, not a bloody swamp”.

“It wasn’t my fault,” Jenny huffed again, starting to lose the slippery cool of her on-screen persona. Keira could tell that this was bothering Jenny, and bothering Jenny was not an easy thing to do. Whatever had happened, it was probably one of two things: embarrassing or illegal.

Keira didn’t much care which: she’d been doing this job for a long time, and covering up her client’s scandalous off-camera misdeeds was just part of the package. She’d seen it all- drugs, prostitutes, fights. The tabloids ate that kind of stuff up like it was candy, and it was her responsibility to make sure they never found out. She rarely failed. So she was starting to lose her patience. If Jenny cooperated then they would stand a much better chance of fixing this- whatever ‘this’ was.

“Listen, kid,” she growled, adopting a tone she reserved only for those rare moments when she knew she needed to instil a little bit of fear into a client’s mind, “I don’t care if you dropped them in the Thames or swapped them for a gram of coke. I just need you to tell me the truth, or we’re never going to work this out”.

Jenny swallowed. She was cornered. In that moment she looked less like one of the world’s most powerful social media stars and more like the unqualified, friendless early-twenties gossip girl she actually was. After a pause that seemed to go on forever, she opened her mouth.

“I was... ill,” she said delicately.

“What, you mean you threw up on them?”

“No”.

“Explain,” ordered Keira.

“I was in Piccadilly,” she said dully, “I went to get food, and then I started getting stomach cramps”.

Keira’s heart sank. She knew now exactly where this story was headed, and it wasn’t good. If her suspicion was right, there was no chance the jeans would have been salvageable even if Jenny had held onto them.

“Oh, Jenny,” she groaned, almost feeling something approaching sympathy, “why didn’t you just go? It’s Piccadilly, there’s bathrooms everywhere. You can’t move ten feet without walking into one”.

“You know I can’t go in public toilets,” Jenny whined, “they’re dirty and full of people. And what if someone recognises me? It’s bad for my image”.

Not for the first time at that meeting, Kiera found herself wanting to tell Jenny to grow up and get over herself. But she didn’t. Instead she said “isn’t crapping yourself worse for your image?”

“Well, yeah,” Jenny said, her face turning red, “but I thought I could make it home. I was only half an hour away”.

“Jenny, you have the worst bodily control of anyone I’ve ever met,” Keira said bluntly, “what the hell made you think you could hold it?”

She wasn’t mincing her words, but Keira was right about that: Jenny had always been supremely accident-prone, to an extent that was almost unheard of amongst women of her age. Keira knew (through her slightly illegal readings of Jenny’s medical records) that doctors had agreed that there was nothing medically wrong with her, and yet she seemed to wet herself at least once a month and mess herself a couple of times a year, too. It was a mystery to Jenny, but Keira thought she had a good idea of why it happened: Jenny was careless, cocky and lazy. She would rather check her phone for two minutes than use the bathroom before leaving the house, even if she knew she wouldn’t get another chance to empty herself for hours. And, predictably, that led to some humiliating accidents, which Keira usually had to try and keep out of the public eye.

She still had some avid memories of her first experiences in this field. Oh, she’d been younger then, and far more naive than she’d become in the more recent years. That more optimistic, less hardened, happier Keira- the pre-Jenny Keira- had never in a million years expected that so much of her job would consist of babysitting what essentially boiled down to a badly toilet-trained kid. So, when Jenny had wet her pants for the first time in front of Keira, she’d had no idea what to do.

They had been at the Shorty Awards, one of the premium events in the social media world. Jenny was almost brand-new to the scene, and Keira had only just taken the girl under her wing, seeing in her the potential for huge popularity (and a hell of a lot of money) that most agents didn’t notice until the contract between the two women was already signed and sealed. Had Keira spotted Jenny and tried to acquire her as a client just a couple of months later, it would have been too late- she blew up a few months later, gained half a million followers in a few weeks, and by then she wouldn’t have looked twice at a small-time rep like Keira. Then Keira would surely have run out of money and been forced to quit the industry for a safer job. For that, she was grateful to Jenny, even if she didn’t much respect her.

The evening had been going smoothly. Jenny didn’t win anything- she was still a newbie, after all, and couldn’t compete with the big names of that era like Zoella or Pewdiepie- but she was nominated in two categories, so her presence was expected. Only at the end of the night did Keira have any more to do than smile and clap politely. Right after leaving, pushing through the crowds to emerge onto a bustling New York street, Jenny had turned to Keira with panic in her eyes.

“Shit, Keira, I really need a wee,” she’d whispered.

Keira remembered that, at the time, she’d been no more than a little confused. Jenny was young, sure, but she was still an adult and there didn’t seem to be any reason why she couldn’t have just gone in the Times Centre. There’d been no warning, no sign at all that the girl needed the bathroom until then. So Keira assumed- wrongly- that she’d have no problem holding it until they got back to the hotel.

“We’ll be home in fifteen minutes,” Keira had said impatiently, not understanding just yet what the fuss was about.

But Jenny wasn’t having any of it. Now it was clear to see the way she’d been squirming, thighs glued together, knees bent as she walked. “I don’t think I can hold it that long,” she whined.

Uncomfortable, Keira had pressed on anyway. She was sure that Jenny had to be exaggerating. Nobody went from neutral to desperate that quickly, unless the girl had some kind of incontinence-inducing medical condition which she’d failed to disclose in her contract. So she’d simply assumed that everything would be fine and it would all end with Jenny taking a nice long piss in the hotel toilet.

How wrong she’d been. They’d only been walking for a few minutes, heading to the nearest Subway station, at the end of 8th Avenue. That was when it happened. Right outside the stairs that led down towards the station, still surrounded by people, when Jenny had suddenly stopped. By the time Keira had realised that she’d left her client behind and turned around to find her frozen on the spot, it was too late. In the fluorescent lights of the high street, there was no mistaking the rivers flowing out from behind her short black shirt and down her legs. For a moment, while Jenny stood and stared in shame at the puddle forming beneath her, Keira was too shocked to do anything. Then she’d spotted a guy, no older than maybe twenty-five, pointing his phone camera at Jenny and laughing.

At that, she’d snapped into action, almost gleeful to finally get the chance to do the part of her job she was best at. This was the part of her job that made her feel alive. Reputation was everything, and if this news got out then Jenny’s fledgeling reputation would take a hit it couldn’t afford. And that meant Keira losing income, which she literally couldn’t afford. She grabbed the man’s phone and swiftly pocketed it before marching Jenny away and into the first taxi she saw, happy to pay the cab fare if it meant nobody else saw her client with piss all down her legs. That night Jenny had been too embarrassed to say much. Only the next day, over breakfast, did Keira coax the truth out of her: Jenny had always been accident-prone, even though doctors said it was purely psychological. This was hardly earth-shattering news, but Keira wished she’d gotten a heads-up.

Since then there had been countless more accidents, and over time these bizarre moments had turned into something Keira had never expected: A normal part of life. There was no longer anything surprising about Jenny admitting to her agent that she was bursting for the toilet, and she'd grown so used to it now that she knew exactly how to tackle the situation. In fact, Keira had gotten into the habit, whenever out somewhere public with Jenny, of finding out exactly where the nearest bathrooms were so that she could get her there in time if disaster struck- which it often did. The result of this was that Jenny's accidents had gradually grown less and less frequent. Emergencies were just as common as ever, it was simply that fewer of them ended in a soaking these days.

Poop accidents were a different story. They were by far less frequent that Jenny’s wetting incidents, although still far more common than almost any other adult in England, Keira was sure. That meant that, fortunately, Keira had rarely had to deal with it personally. They tended to happen while Jenny was on a night out with her friends, at a restaurant or (sometimes) just lounging at home and leaving it too late to go to the bathroom. Only twice had Keira been present when Jenny had dropped a load into her pants: once on a publicity day at a theme park and once while they were at a photoshoot in London.

From those two days, she thought she had a pretty good grasp of how Jenny’s bowels worked: she would get a sudden urge, and then have maybe half an hour to find a bathroom before things got too desperate, the need overwhelmed her and she had an accident. And when that happened, well… it was enough to say that Jenny’s dumps were never small. That was why Keira had known that the jeans were beyond help as soon as she’d figured out that Jenny had pooped in them. If Keira crapped herself, the damage would probably be limited to the underwear- not that she’d ever done it. There was no chance of that with Jenny; the loads were far too big.

“I just thought this time might be different,” Jenny protested, even though it was quite clear that the real reason for her not making it was her snobbery. She thought she was too good for a public bathroom and preferred to risk messing herself than to set foot in one… which was just one of the many reasons why Keira had come to view her as a conceited, spoilt kid. She supposed she was partly to blame for that. At the end of the day, Keira was one of the leading figures in Jenny’s transformation from a fairly normal kid into a diva.

“Jesus Christ, Jenny,” she said, unable to hide her frustration, “what happened next?”

“I got on the tube, and it was really embarrassing. I had to keep bouncing around and squirming everywhere. I looked like a kid”.

“Did anyone recognise you?” asked Keira. She couldn’t give two shits if Jenny was embarrassed, as long as the internet didn’t find out about it. This was the bit that really worried her. Once something got on the internet it was there forever. She’d seen someone on Reddit once talking about the incident in New York, but that didn’t bother Keira: barely anyone would ever read the thing, and even if they did, they were unlikely to believe that a grown woman would wet herself so publicly like that. More likely, people would assume that it was just a lie told by a bitter troll. This was different, though, because Keira hadn’t been on that tube train to make sure nobody saw her client wriggling like a child from an urgent need to shit.

“No,” Jenny said with a quick shake of her head, “there were only, like, three people on the carriage and they were all super old. I doubt any of them knew who I was”.

Keira breathed a sigh of relief- one less thing to worry about.

“But then I farted. I couldn’t help it, it just came out. I thought it might be silent but, like, I’m pretty sure everyone on the train heard it”.

Jenny looked mortified, but the woman opposite her almost wanted to laugh. Her personal view was that a little embarrassment every now and then was exactly what Jenny needed to keep her feet in some semblance of contact with the ground. Again, though, that wasn’t something you said to your boss, even if she was a superficial brat.

“Okay, so what happened next?” Keira pressed, hoping to find out as much as she could. The damage to the jeans was done, but she needed to know exactly what other damage she might need to clean up. The devil was in the detail. “I need you to tell me everything”.

“What? Why?” Jenny asked, looking horrified. She seemed to have thought that she would come into this meeting, explain that she’d lost the jeans and there would be no further questions asked. The reality that she was currently being faced with was far more uncomfortable- and awkward- than that. Which was ironic, for several reasons.

Around her friends (if you could call them that), Jenny wasn’t remotely shy with things like this. Keira knew that because she’d read plenty of their group chats on WhatsApp, although Jenny could never find out about that, of course. Some would call it an invasion of privacy- okay, almost everyone would call it an invasion of privacy. To Keira, though, it was a necessary evil. It was vital that she made sure the public kept seeing Jenny in a good light. Reading Jenny’s messages was the only way to get some peace of mind that she wasn’t going to do anything controversial or scandalous- blackface, for example, or cocaine. Besides, it was hardly difficult. All of Jenny’s passwords had been password for as long as they’d known each other. And if it was true that Jenny going down would take Keira down with her… well, wasn’t she just doing what was best for both of them?

She didn't need reminding of the most recent of these conversations that she had, ethically or not, been reading for at least three years. It wasn't something Keira enjoyed, or at least she liked to tell herself that. It meant she had to see everything, from Jenny's mundane conversations with her dad to risqué sexting with random boys to risky exchanges with her weed dealer. Keira was keeping tabs on this last one, just in case he ever felt like running his mouth off to the tabloids for a few easy quid. For her part, Jenny probably thought Keira had no idea she even smoked.

But the one that came to Keira's mind at that exact moment was from just a week before their coffee shop meeting. She'd logged onto Jenny's WhatsApp account just after lunchtime, using software she'd downloaded that made her undetectable, and was surprised to see Jenny and a few of the parasites she called her posse in mid-conversation. While it was certainly not the first toilet-related chat she'd read on Jenny's profile, it was one of the few that she didn't forget immediately after reading. She could remember it so vividly that the exact words were almost imprinted in her brain. They’d been in the middle of some boring chatter about a stupid TV show when Jenny had changed the subject.

Ugh, I really need a poo, she’d written, followed by some annoyed emojis.

Me too, but way too lazy, had come a reply from Phoebe, one of the rich kids Jenny knew from school.

Nah, like really REALLY need a poo, Jenny had said, I can feel it poking out

I did a huge one this morning, another girl wrote, accompanied by a purple devil face, but you talking about it makes me need one again. This one was named Zara, and she was usually the one who bought the drugs to a party as far as Keira could work out.

Can’t be fucked 2 get up, Jenny explained. Just did the worst fart everrr.

Lol

Had like three cups of coffee this morning, said Phoebe, it always makes me have 2 take a dump.

Yeah coffee goes right through me, I need a wee as well, Zara had agreed.

Always need a piss when I need a shit x Jenny had said. Keira had watched this conversation unfold with a mixture of disgust and amusement, most of it no more interesting than what she’d already read, until:

When ur busting for a poo but the bed is so comfy, came a message from Jenny, accompanied by a gif of an angry young girl.

Just poop the bed, said Phoebe.

Lol- Zara again.

Mmmmm I might do it, Keira had read. Until then she’d assumed Jenny was joking, but that message made her eyes widen and her back straighten. It’s really desperate, don’t know if I can hold.

What- seriously? Phoebe asked.

Do u dare me? 😉 came Jenny’s response, can always clean it up later x

Phoebe had hammered out her reply quickly, followed by plenty of shocked faces. I didn’t think u would acc do it!!!

Then had followed one of the most shocking things Keira had read in three years of checking her client’s messages:

Nah, can’t make it 2 loo, its coming out. A relieved emoji.

Rn?!?!?!???

Yeah x couldn’t hold it anymore

OMG!!! ur shitting the bed?

Feels amazing! Jenny had said, oh shit, I’m weeing too. Can’t even stop it.

Nah u must be winding us up, insisted Zara. Keira, at the time, had to agree. There was no way Jenny was really pooping and peeing her bed- was there?

Except she really was, and the image that Jenny sent in response confirmed it. In it, her legs and bare bum were visible, twisted to the side to hide her pussy. The bedsheets were soaked, their usual light pink instead a hot, blood red. And on the centre, piled right between where her thighs had clearly been, was unmistakably a very large pile of poo.

That image had been burned into Keira’s brain, unshift-able. Now, looking across the table at Jenny, it was hard to think of anything else. But she had to. Jenny liked to tell her friends every last detail, and now Keira had to coax that same level of information out of her.

“I can only help you if you’re honest with me, hun,” she said, squeezing her voice through that cookie-cutter of patience she’d honed so well over the years.

It couldn’t be much clearer how deeply unhappy Jenny was with the turn the conversation had taken, but Keira knew that she’d co-operate in the end. She always did. The girl lacked the necessary backbone to rebel.

“So, you farted,” Keira pressed, “what happened next?”

Across from her, Jenny exhaled through her nose, eyes furious. Then, reluctantly, she began to talk.

“I got off at my stop a few minutes later, but then, on the escalator- I couldn’t help it- I farted again,” she whispered, “only this one- this one was… wet”. Her cheeks were a deep red, and her voice was almost inaudibly quiet, as if she was paranoid that someone a few tables over might be recording the conversation. In another context Keira might have been impressed; she hadn’t known for sure until then that Jenny even had a quiet voice. But she still smelt a rat. Clearly this wasn’t the whole story.

“Okay, so you sharted,” Keira said, trying to wrap her head around this, “why did that mean you had to throw the whole pair jeans out?”.

Jenny huffed, and for a moment there was a hint- just a hint- of real anger in her eyes, before it was swiftly replaced by that hot-flushed shame once again. It was the first time that Keira truly appreciated that, though Jenny was technically still her boss, she was the one who was really in control. She knew the secrets, and therefore she held the power.

“Come on, Keira,” she whined eventually, “don’t make me say it”.

“No, I’m gonna make you say it,” Keira insisted, refusing to be deterred, “I’m not dropping this until I know exactly what happened, okay?”

“Fine!” Jenny looked away, possibly in search of some hole in the earth she could dive into, “By the time I got up to the street, it was really hard to walk. I could feel it, you know, poking out. And I was really trying to suck it back in, but nothing was working".

"Well, no shit," said Keira bluntly, ignoring the unintended pun, "that's not how bodies work. You can't just suck a log back in".

"I had to try something".

"Couldn't you have tried pooping before leaving the house?" she sniped.

Jenny pulled back like a wounded animal. She seemed to be searching for something to say that would rescue her a bit of dignity, give her some kind of defence. Instead, she offered up the most childish explanation possible.

"I didn't need to go then," she said sourly. Keira remembered that one. It was the oldest excuse in the book- so old that she hadn't heard it since she was in primary school. It was almost absurd hearing this grown woman use it now, two decades later. But then, wasn't that what Jenny was? Her body had grown up but her mind had never been given any motive to do the same. For the last four years she'd been rewarded for acting like a spoilt teen. Maybe this was the inevitable consequence.

"Okay, whatever," Keira said dismissively. She couldn't be bothered to waste too much time thinking about what were, ultimately, unimportant details. There was still so much more that she needed to find out, starting with: "so where did it... you know?"

"Where did what?" Jenny repeated, sounding more like a parrot than a person. There was no telling whether she was being deliberately obtuse or she was genuinely just not bright enough to know what she was being asked. With Jenny, it was usually hard to make a distinction between the two.

"Where did you shit yourself, Jenny?" she said, losing patience again. She must have spoken a little too loudly in her annoyance; a few people at other tables turned their heads, as if they weren't sure if they had misheard. Jenny flushed an even darker shade of red, which Keira hadn't realised was even possible. The girl- who almost never went out in public without enough fake tan on to make her look like a walking apricot- was suddenly a colour closer to a tomato, or perhaps a strawberry. Any darker and she could pass as a living sunburn awareness display. Keira was more or less past caring how embarrassed her 'client' was by that point. The news of losing the twelve-hundred-pound trousers had infuriated her, and she wanted this meeting over with as soon as possible so that she could get to work minimising the damage (which, ironically, was the very thing that Jenny had failed to do to the jeans). What did it matter if Jenny had to swallow a bit of humble pie to make that happen?

Jenny shot daggers at Keira, unable to even look in the direction of the rest of the restaurant. For a brief moment Keira wondered if she might have finally gone too far. She had never had a traditional client-agent relationship with Jenny, always aware of the benefits of keeping the kid under her thumb. If she was too polite, too kind, too forgiving to Jenny, she might just get too big for her boots. If she ever felt that she'd outgrown Keira's capabilities, there was no way she'd renew their contract together when it expired the next year. She'd end up switching to one of the biggest agents, like Logan Paul or Addison Rae had. So Keira had to try and keep her grounded by putting on a bit of the teacher-student act every once in a while. But it would be all too easy to push her a bit too far, and humiliating her in public like this could be the final straw.

And yet, as always, it really was only a brief moment. Jenny did shoot those dagger eyes at her... then dropped her gaze again. Now she wanted this over with just as much as Keira.

"On Oxford Street," she mumbled.

For the fiftieth time that morning, Keira couldn't believe her ears. "Oxford Street?" she repeated, feeling like now perhaps she was the parrot.

"Yeah".

"The literal busiest street in Europe?"

"I know it sounds bad-" Jenny began, but Keira wasn't finished.

"Oxford Street! Sixty thousand roads in this fucking city and you choose the one that's never not jammed with people!" she was aware now that her voice was rising, but so was the panic in her chest, tightening like the knot of a noose. Jenny had lied to her. She'd tricked her into thinking that this was nothing more than a stupid little anecdote and a chunk of money wasted, and now suddenly she was finding out that her biggest client had messed herself in the middle of the most densely populated road in the continent.

She whipped out her phone, the latest Apple model. That, she told herself, is the kind of luxury buy you can say goodbye to if this bimbo's career goes down the toilet. It would have been preferable if her poop had been the thing going down the toilet but you can't fix that now.

Within seconds, she had Twitter open. Jenny was watching, afraid, unable to comprehend why Keira was so upset. Into the search bar she hammered a few key searches, checking back a few days each time to make sure there was nothing there.

Jennifer Martez poo. No recent results.

Jennifer Martez crap. No recent results.

Jennifer Martez poop. One recent result, from some guy who claimed to want Jenny to poop on his chest. Whatever floats your boat- that was Keira's motto. She kept scrolling. Nothing else under those search terms from the last week.

Jennifer Martez shit. Plenty of recent results, but thankfully most of them seemed to be from people who thought Jenny's videos were shit, which Keira didn't mind or even particularly disagree with.

Then, finally, one more- just to be on the safe side.

Jennifer Martez oxford street. Nothing at all, except for tweets about a book signing Jenny had done on Oxford Street the year before. But Keira wasn't done yet. She went back and searched each term again, replacing Jennifer with Jenny. Still nothing. Only then, finally, did she start to relax. Her breathing eased, and she looked grimly up at Jenny. She'd almost forgotten the girl was even still there. If her client had gotten up and walked out while Keira was checking Twitter, she probably wouldn't have noticed.

"I think you got away with it, kid," she said finally. Later she would check Instagram, Facebook, Google and (just to be safe) Reddit, but if it wasn't on Twitter by now, chances are nobody who saw the accident had recognised her after all. For a girl with several million followers, a huge chunk of which lived in London alone, that surely had to be considered a huge slice of luck.

“I told you,” hissed Jenny, “people are staring”.

Keira took a glance around and realised that Jenny was right. Observation wasn’t usually her strong suit unless her reputation was concerned. She caught at least two people looking up at her, who quickly averted their gaze at the sight of Keira’s flickering eyes. Scaring people just a little wasn’t hard; as long as she was confident, one glare could make them believe that she could ruin their lives if they gave her any reason. Nonetheless, the situation had grown a little too public for Keira’s tastes. They needed to talk somewhere where she was certain they wouldn’t be overheard.

Eventually she relented. “Fine. Let’s get out of here”.

———————————————————————————————————————————

Within minutes they had stumbled into Russell Square, one of the few open areas in walking distance that was big enough to ensure a private conversation. A huge park dotted with arching, shady trees, Keira had always found it a reliable place to avoid prying ears, which was a necessity far more often than she’d expected in her line of work. They walked in stormy silence, Keira seething with frustration, Jenny towing along like a student being marched to the headteacher’s office. When they spilled through the gates, both were relieved to find the square as quiet as they’d expected at this time on a Wednesday morning. There was a couple having a picnic, a man walking a dog, but nobody near enough to make out what they were saying. That was ideal, because Keira still had one burning question she needed to ask.

“Here’s what I don’t get: why not tell me?” she groaned, hoping for both their sakes that Jenny had a good answer, “If you’d told me right away we could’ve sorted this out days ago. Now I’ve got a pissed off mega corporation, a bunch of pissed off sponsors and we’re twelve hundred down”.

“Well…” Jenny began, “usually you don’t need to find out”.

“Usually?”

“Yeah. I mean, this has happened before”.

“Ah,” Keira said flatly, “well, I probably should’ve guessed”. She was done being surprised at this point. By now, if Jenny had told her that she was actually a cow named Martin dressed in a human costume, Keira would’ve found it maybe the third or fourth most interesting revelation of the morning.

“But it’s never usually a problem,” Jenny protested, “I always just message the company directly, tell them I need a second item and I get one. No questions asked”.

“So, purely out of interest, how many pairs of jeans have you ruined since I started managing you?” Keira’s voice was dripping with enough sarcasm to water a garden of irony.

“Um…”

Keira was proven wrong right away: this girl could still surprise her after all. “You’ve lost count?”

“It’s not just jeans, though!” Jenny said defensively, “sometimes it’s bikinis, or lingerie”.

“How is that better? That’s worse!” Keira had never heard such exasperation in her own voice.

“I don’t know! I’ve always gotten away with it”.

“Yeah, well, Gucci aren’t Victoria’s bloody Secret,” Keira growled, “of course they’re not going to give you a free pair, not at that price”.

Jenny looked down. “I probably should’ve known that. But I was hoping they’d cave in if I kept asking”.

A thought popped into Keira’s mind. “Wait a moment, Jenny,” she began, “how often does this happen? Just give me your best guess”.

“Uh, three or four times a year, maybe?”

“Is that why your review was so late on that Ann Summers swimwear?”

“Maybe,” Jenny said quietly.

“So yes, then,” Keira decided.

“It wasn’t my fault. They should warn you not to go to a water park after eating spicy food”.

“You pooed yourself in a swimming pool?”

“Technically, no,” she said, “I was on a slide”.

“How have you never been caught doing this yet?” Keira was almost beside herself with the strangest mix of emotions she’d ever encountered: anger, confusion, sympathy and a bizarre desire to laugh.

“I don’t know,” she sighed, frustrated, “it’s like… I always almost make it in time, so whenever I have… you know… an accident, I’m always close enough to the loo that I can just get in there before anyone recognises me. That’s why nobody ever finds out”.

“Hang on”. Something dawned on Keira then. At first she thought it was a crazy idea, a paranoid flight of fancy. But was it? This was Jenny she was talking about. Suddenly that crazy idea seemed perfectly believable. “This doesn’t have anything to do with the car thing, does it?”

Jenny didn’t answer, and her silence told Keira all she needed to know.

“For God’s sake, Jenny. What happened?”

“I was driving back from Alton Towers, and there was traffic,” Jenny mumbled.

“Couldn’t you just stop somewhere?”

“I tried, but it was rush hour,” she said, blushing, “and I drank a lot during the day and… I couldn’t hold it. I really tried, though, honestly. I know sometimes I give up easily when I’m busting for a wee, ‘cos I’d rather just buy new jeans than hold it for ages. But I didn’t want to ruin the car, I’d only just got it. I was squeezing and grabbing and bouncing and everything but it came out anyway, I was too desperate. I took it to the cleaner but she said the seat was too far gone and I’d never get the smell out, so I bought the new car”.

Keira wanted time to absorb this news- sorting out the replacement car had been a long and expensive process- but she was distracted by something. Jenny was fidgeting. Not a lot, not enough that she had noticed earlier, but subtly. She was changing position every few seconds, shifting her minute weight from one foot to the other and back again. And her knees- they weren’t crossed, but they were certainly bent slightly, and they looked as though they really wanted to fold over one another. They’d just come from a coffee shop, where Jenny had polished off a large latte. And coffee always made Jenny need the bathroom. Keira had to wonder…

“Jenny, do you need a wee right now?”

Jenny blushed again. “Yeah, why?” she said.

“Do you need a poo as well?” she said sternly, feeling strangely like a mother talking to her kid. Jenny shook her head once, tight-lipped, but there was a smell in the air that said otherwise. “I’m pretty sure you’ve farted,” she pressed.

“Okay, fine,” Jenny confessed, “coffee always makes me need a poo, you know that”.

Keira just sighed. “Yeah, me too. You gonna make it back to your place in time?” Before the girl could reply, she hastened to add, “think carefully before you answer that”.

Jenny weighed up her options for a few seconds, then conceded. “No, probably not,” she said quietly.

"Fine, my apartment's really close. You can use my loo, then we'll try and figure out this whole Gucci jean thing".

Jenny was in no position to argue, which was how Keira knew she really was desperate. Ordinarily Jenny would definitely protest violently against the idea of using Keira's bathroom. She'd only ever done so once before, when she was on the verge of an accident and had no other choice. On that occasion she'd blocked the toilet with a monster dump that had taken hours to get rid of. Keira hoped that today wouldn't see a repeat of that.

As she'd already been reminded a few times that morning, once Jenny realised she needed the toilet it was never long before she grew utterly bursting. After a few minutes of walking it was clear that the younger woman was struggling to hold on. Keira felt bad for her. She knew that this was the perfect microcosm of their relationship: most of the time she deeply disliked Jenny, finding her superficial, vain and selfish. She never had any patience for the girl's misadventures or her awful control over bodily functions. And yet... she did care. In a weird way. Sometimes.

By the time they reached Keira's apartment- no more than five minutes away, but it felt far longer under the suspense of a potential public accident- Jenny was bouncing on the spot to keep it all inside her tiny frame. The moment they were safely inside her building, her left hand shot down to her crotch and grabbed it tightly, squeezing like a vice.

"Oh, God, I don't think I'm going to make it," Jenny whined. This time Keira heard it: a small, muffled fart that slipped out as she was led up the stairs.

"Why didn't you tell me you had to go earlier?" Keira said, annoyed but primarily now concerned.

"I didn't want you to be angry," came the meek reply.

"It doesn't matter now, we're here". Keira fished her keys out of her pocket and started unlocking the door. She was starting to seriously need the bathroom now, for both things- enough that she really hoped Jenny wouldn't take too long on the loo- but it was clear that the younger woman's needs were more urgent, so she let Jenny go ahead and use the toilet first.

Keira had barely closed the door before Jenny sat down on the toilet. The noise was quite something. There was no pause between her toned bum hitting the seat and the beginning of an explosion of runny poo that echoed in the bowl. She heard the groan of relief, which started out half-shy but quickly lost all inhibitions and became a growl of pure pleasure at making it just on time. Then came the pee, hissing down into what Keira presumed were already poop-filled waters. Hearing Jenny go, having barely avoided ruining her underwear, was only making Keira's need more pressing. Usually her control was great but this wasn't the first time she'd wished she had an apartment with two bathrooms. She set down her coat and headed slowly towards her flat's toilet.

Jenny was there, as expected, and she hadn't managed to close the door before sitting down. It was wide open, and for a second Keira got a brief glance of her client sitting on the loo in pure bliss, voiding herself ferociously at both ends, eyes closed from the overwhelming intensity of the feelings. Her private parts were on full display between her legs and she didn't seem to care. Keira felt an urgent need to fart, instinctively suppressed it and then realised there was no need. She let it go, loud and powerful, and Jenny didn't even notice.

"Uh, Jenny," she began tentatively, not wanting to intrude but feeling that she was running out of time, "could you try and hurry up? I really need to go as well".

"Yeah, sorry," Jenny said, "I'll be as quick as I can. Just got-" she paused, grunted and out came another log with a splash, "a little bit more left. There, I think I'm done". She started grabbing toilet paper and wiping quickly, sensing the genuine urgency in Keira's voice. "Sorry I didn't close the door," she said bashfully.

"It's okay," Keira said, "I'm just glad you didn't leave a puddle on the floor".
