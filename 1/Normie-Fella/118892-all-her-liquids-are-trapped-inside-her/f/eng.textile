All her liquids are trapped inside her

Hello everyone, so basically it's my first time writing a story and since I was nervous, I used a little AI to help grammartise my story, the plot and writing is fully mine only some parts were used AI to avoid improper English. Hope you'll enjoy it and maybe if I don't die tomorrow, I'll continue this story...

*8:30am, Inside Kibo’s lucid dream*

Kibo wandered frantically through the office corridors, desperately searching for a toilet. Every stall she opened revealed not a porcelain bowl but an empty meeting room stacked with projectors, whiteboards, and folders. Finally, in the last stall, she spotted it: a single, gleaming toilet, pristine and inviting, almost mocking her with its availability.

But Kibo was a lady who prided herself on her impeccable image. For six months she had cultivated her reputation as the “Iron-Bladdered Girl,” never once seen using the office restroom. The nickname thrilled the men in secret fantasies and sparked quiet jealousy among the older women. She couldn’t—wouldn’t—break now, not in front of anyone.

Yet the pressure was unbearable. Her pride was crumbling. She knew that the longer she clung to it, the more likely she’d destroy both it and her clothes. Both hands clamped between her thighs in a vise-like grip, she staggered toward the construction workers who had inexplicably appeared, begging them to stop. They ignored her completely.

If she didn’t use that toilet now, she would wet herself—just like she had in school when she’d underestimated her limits. As the workers raised their hammers to smash the final porcelain bowl, Kibo lunged forward. But a strong male hand—belonging to one of her coworkers—landed squarely on her distended lower abdomen, pinning her in place. The sudden pressure made her knees buckle. She squirmed, trying to twist away, but every movement only intensified the ache. Then the hand squeezed—firm, deliberate—and a hot, lengthy spurt escaped into her panties until…

*8:50 am, Kibo’s bedroom*

The alarm blared.

Kibo jolted upright, heart racing, legs instinctively pressed together. She glanced down at her crotch and the bedsheets—dry. Relief flooded her. No accident. Not yet.

At twenty-one, Kibo was stunning: long dark hair, a slim waist, and full 36DD breasts that turned heads. Fresh out of college in April, she’d landed a well-paid billing assistant role at a prestigious firm. She’d thrown herself into the job, prioritizing deadlines and professionalism above everything—including her own basic needs. Hydration was non-negotiable for focus, but bathroom breaks? Never during work hours. The office had crowned her “The Iron-Bladdered Girl,” a title whispered with admiration, envy, and hidden male fascination. No one had ever seen her squirm… until perhaps today.

The alarm had snoozed ten times already. It was 8:50 a.m. She needed to be at her desk by 9:30. No time for the mirror. Hungover from last night’s clubbing with Helga, her head throbbed, distracting her from the heavy fullness low in her abdomen—the 1.5 liters of cocktails she’d downed before collapsing into bed without peeing.

*8:53am, Kibo's Kitchen*

She dashed to the fridge for breakfast. Empty, except for a large watermelon and a cucumber. Groceries forgotten in last night’s haze. Delivery would take too long. She pulled the watermelon out to warm up while she rushed through her morning routine.

*8:56 am, Kibo's Bedroom and later in Kitchen*

Kibo yanked on her favorite white lace panties and a mismatched blue bra, then threw on a fitted blue top and gray formal pants. No time to coordinate. In the kitchen, she devoured enough watermelon to equal 1.2 liters of watery content in just minutes, chasing it with a large 750 ml mug of strong black coffee to combat the hangover. She grabbed her bag and bolted.

*9:15 am, Bus stop*

She made it to the bus stop in record time, panting. Thirst clawed at her throat—she’d forgotten to pack lunch and her usual water bottles. Going back wasn’t an option. The bus was due in two minutes.

Spotting a small shop, she bought a 200 ml bottle of cold water and chugged it immediately. As she paid, her bus pulled in. She sprinted and boarded a packed vehicle—no seats, standing room only. Bodies pressed in from all sides.

The constant swaying and jostling should have been agony, but Kibo barely noticed. Fear of being late and the pounding headache kept her mind elsewhere—for now.

*9:25 am, Train station*

Only five minutes until the train. Panic rising, she called Marcus, her closest colleague.

“Marcus… dude, I need a favor.”

“FORGET THE FAVOR—WHERE ARE YOU?!”

“Long story. I’ll explain later.”

“Boss is already asking for you.”

“Seriously? I’m always early, and the one day I’m late—”

“I know, I know. He’s mad about the sales return file. Thinks you never passed it to the accountant.”

“I did—through Kate!”

“Tell him yourself. Just get here fast. And… you okay? You sound rough.”

“Helga’s birthday last night. She forced one and a half liters of cocktails down me. Headache’s killing me. Can you grab that migraine cream from the pharmacy cabinet?”

A pause.

“You drank that much? No wonder. Fine, I’ll stall him and get the cream. But you owe me a drink tonight.”

“Deal. Gotta run—train’s here.”

She hung up, memory flashing: Helga driving her home, Kibo stumbling straight to bed, clothes on, no bathroom stop.

Now the math hit her like a wave.

1.5 L alcohol last night (held ~12 hours).

1.2 L watermelon this morning.

750 ml strong coffee (diuretic in full effect).

200 ml water at the bus stop.

3 liters total almost all of it now pressing mercilessly inside her swollen bladder. More liquid still being filtered by her kidneys mercilessly pumping inside her bladder soon.

It felt like an overinflated water balloon stretched to its absolute limit—hard, hot, and protruding noticeably beneath her fitted pants. A sudden, vicious spasm ripped through her, forcing her to freeze mid-step and squeeze her thighs together hard. For the first time, real fear flickered in her chest. A tiny, warm bead of moisture escaped into her white lace panties before she clamped down.

She shifted her bag to her front, using it to subtly shield the small bulge as she hurried toward the platform, walking with short, careful steps, thighs brushing with every stride.

Today was going to be absolute hell. But she knew she had to stay strong. She isn't a small baby who can't hold her pee. She's older now. She's not the school kid who peed herself as she had held her pee for 15 hours and relief was just 15 seconds away.

To be continued...
