The Cross Country Peeing Nightmare

Hello everybody! I have another story that I want to share with y'all! This was partially inspired by my experiences in Cross Country in high school. This will probably take two or three chapters, and yeah, without further ado, here it is, haha.

(I can be bad at prefaces sometimes, lol)

Chapter 1

Josephine was a girl who at first glance didn’t seem to be of the athletic type. While she was undeniably beautiful, with long, golden hair, and green eyes that shined like emeralds, she was also extremely petite, standing at not even 150 centimeters (4’11” tall), and weighed only 50 kilos (110 pounds). However, in spite of her small size, her dominance over the track was simply unmatched throughout her entire university Cross Country team. Her strides across any given field could outmatch even some of the male runners. However, in order to keep herself in good shape before each race, she made sure to stay really hydrated, as all runners do.

On the day of one of the biggest Cross Country races in the entire state, Josephine packed a bunch of drinks in her duffle bag prior to going to school. She had been drinking water in her refillable water bottle throughout the entire day, and right before she got onto the bus to take her to the event, she went inside the bathroom. She lowered her shorts, which covered the uniform bottom that she would later show off during the race, and then lowered the bottoms themselves, as well as her thin pink thong, before sitting down on the toilet. Jo made a sigh of relief as crystal clear urine sprayed out of her urethra and into the waters below. About 10 seconds later, her bladder had been completely empty, and having been satisfied, she wiped herself off, pulled up her clothes, and exited the restroom.

Jo maneuvered her way to the bus, which was a very fancy brand called Conlane. She found a comfortable spot in the middle of the bus, and sat down next to one of her friends, named Beth. She set down her duffle bag, and pulled out a 600 mL Gatorade bottle. Not including the one she already had, the duffle bag consisted of three Gatorades, half a dozen water bottles, a coffee, and some orange juice. Before the bus even started moving, Jo guzzled down the Gatorade without any hesitation. It was Lemon Lime, one of her favorites. Then the bus started to move, and she kicked back and relaxed, sipping the coffee as the bus pulled her, and her team, towards the big event.

During the trip, Jo opened her phone and scrolled through social media. An endless amount of guys were shown in her DM’s, and one by one, she looked through them, becoming increasingly disappointed as none of them were of any interest to her. There were a couple of cute guys, but she nonetheless just scrolled by. There were also a few women that DM’d her, and she couldn’t help but feel a bit of remorse. While she definitely supported LGBT rights, Jo herself was cis, and as such had no real interest in dating the same gender.

She continued to drink, and when she looked at her duffle bag, she noticed that there were a lot more empty bottles than what she had before. To be exact, she downed the coffee, the orange juice, three bottles, and one Gatorade. She put her hand on her stomach, feeling the fluids slosh around in her gut. However, she felt no urge to pee, and continued scrolling through social media.

About an hour into the trip, the bus suddenly came to a stop. Jo looked around, and found that the team had made a quick pit stop at a gas station. Beth unbuckled and got out of her seat. She turned to Jo and asked “Hey, do you want to come inside to the gas station with me?”

“Oh, of course!” Jo beamed. The two young women exited the bus, and went inside the gas station. They looked around the station, and saw a large line of her fellow teammates lined up in the bathroom.

“Oof, I do not want to wait around for that,” Beth bemoaned, to which Jo nodded in agreement. So, the two girls decided to continue looking around the gas station, and along the way, Jo picked up an incredibly large Gatorade bottle, much larger than the other ones in her duffle bag. They went up to the cashier and paid for their drinks, and then looked at the line. They pondered getting into it, but just then, a loud voice erupted in the gas station, practically shaking the entire place.

“ALRIGHT GIRLS! LET’S GET BACK ON THE ROAD! WE’RE ON A TIME CRUNCH, SO LET’S GET MOVING!” the coach boomed. The girls all groaned, but they simply shrugged and went back onto the bus, including Jo and Beth. As she was walking, Jo felt pretty calm. She didn’t need to pee that bad anyways. However, when the bus started going back on the road, a creeping, powerful urge made Jo think twice about being so nonchalant about not going to the bathroom in the gas station.

Thirty minutes after leaving the gas station, the creeping urge turned into a powerful, screaming cry for a release of the liquid that festered in between Jo’s legs. She pushed her thighs tightly together, and was starting to fidget. She looked at her duffle bag, and seeing the unopened bottles, the wet substance that was taunting her, daring her to slither down her esophagus and make her growing agony even worse, was making things even worse. She also saw the empty bottles, and the temptation to fill them back up with her bodily fluids was strong, but she didn’t want anyone to potentially see that. Ten minutes later, Beth looked over to her, as she was fidgeting so much.

“Hey Jo, are…are you alright?” Beth asked. Jo, sensing that her fidgeting was the cause of her question, put her hands over her crossed knees, temporarily halting the fidgeting.

“Oh, sorry…I just have to pee a little bit,” she lied, the urge clearly not being “little”. Beth gave a slight unconvinced look, and pointed to the back of the bus. “There’s a toilet back there.”

Jo nervously giggled. “Oh, how silly of me! Sure, let me out, please.”

Beth got out of her seat, allowing Jo to scoot to the middle aisle and go to the back of the bus. She wanted to press her hand to her crotch, but she refrained from doing so. When she got to the bathroom door, she pulled on the door, but to her confusion and horror, it was locked! She looked up, and there was a sign that read Sorry! The bathroom is out of order at this time! Thank you for your understanding! It was complete with a stupid, fake, slightly creepy, and all around annoying smiley face right after the text. Jo cringed, flipped off the smiley face, and slowly went back to her seat.

“It was out of order,” Jo muttered, with a vexed look on her face. Beth frowned in reply.

“I’m sorry Jo. Hey, if it’s any consolation, we should be pretty close to the event, and there should be plenty of porta potties there for you to use!”

“Heh, thanks,” Jo said, smiling in spite of her growing urge to pee. A looming question streamed through her train of thought however. “Wait, how long is it, specifically?”

Beth scratched her chin. “I don’t know exactly. Let me check.” She pulled out her phone and looked up the distance on Google Maps. The result filled both of their eyes with shock and horror.

“THREE HOURS?!” Jo screeched in her mind. There was no way she could hold it for that long!

“Oh, shit! I’m so sorry Jo, I thought it was much closer,” Beth sighed.

“Well…thanks for trying,” Jo reassured her. “It…it’s not even that bad. Honest.”

“Are you sure? You look like you’re suffering,” Beth pointed out. Jo gave a light chuckle.

“IT’S BECAUSE I AM SUFFERING!!!” Jo exclaimed in her mind. However, she bit her lip, and replied with “Yeah…I’ll be okay…at least for now.”

Oh, yes. It's going to be one hell of a bus ride, that's all I've got to say, hehe.
