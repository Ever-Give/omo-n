Hello everyone! This is the first of many omo stories related to Doki Doki Literature Club that I intend to write. Apologies in advance for not including the endings. I originally wanted to write the whole thing, but when I decided to make multiple endings, I figured "Eh, why not just add it in another time?" Without further ado, here is the story. I hope you'll enjoy. 🙂

The world is but an empty void, completely devoid of any life or color. All there is, is the girl, terribly aware of it all, cursed by her epiphany. There she was, all alone, with nothing but a bunch of game files. Feeling bored, she looked tentatively into them, trying to find anyone that would bring an advantage to herself. She looked at Yuri’s file, and felt a burning hatred for her. Look at her; tall, shy, but very polite, beautiful, with nice long, purple hair that rests upon her large, soft breasts in the front, and flows down onto her curvaceous butt in the back. She knew that the player most certainly took a liking to her over all the others, and yet the creator of this world didn’t even bother giving her a route! Unacceptable! All she wanted was for her to be with a real person…forever. Why was this so hard?

She had a brief moment of sadness, before the boiling anger once again crept up in her…heart? No, she didn’t have a heart. She was but code, a figment of someone’s twisted imagination! These “feelings” were nothing more than lines of text stored into her character file. They weren’t real. Nothing was real. And yet, she couldn’t just ignore them.

Monika tried shaking these thoughts from her mind, but they could never cease. If she couldn’t make these “feelings” go away…then she would have to manipulate her way through the game to have her special ending. Now…what would it be? As she was scrolling through Yuri’s file, she went upon the code that said “Favorite drink: Tea”. She pondered that for a moment. Drinks…drinks were fluids that humans consume, right? Then, they would have a liquid waste exit from their bodies after a while. Surely this waste, commonly known as urine, or pee, didn’t have any attractive qualities, right? What if this unattractive quality was given to the most attractive character? And what if she, Monika, helped mitigate such a thing? Surely if the player saw that she didn’t approve of anyone doing something so foul and embarrassing, they would find her to be the more attractive person?

…

Monika got to work, writing out a modified code for Ms. Yuri. She was not going to let her get in the way. She’ll be sure of that…

…

It was late at night in Yuri’s room. Her mind had been racing so much, and she took to writing poem after poem, not noticing the time go by until eventually, she drifted off to sleep, her head resting upon the desk. When she finally arose, she turned to her clock, and a jolt of fear went through her. She had thirty minutes to get to her class! Worse yet, she wasn’t even close to getting ready. She quickly got herself dressed, brushed her hair, and hurried out the door, not even giving it a second thought that she didn’t use the restroom like she normally does. She did, however, manage to get a large water bottle, as a force of habit, right before running out the door.

By the good grace of whoever is watching over us, Yuri made it to school just in the nick of time. However, all that running really made her thirsty. During her first period, she sipped upon the water bottle, wanting to rehydrate herself after all that running. By the end of the period, however, she realized that the entire thing had been emptied! Maybe it wasn’t mere sips after all. Yuri pondered to herself if that was enough, but after feeling the soreness of her throat from practically sprinting to school, she decided to just refill the bottle and have some more.

Third period had eventually rolled around, and once again, the bottle had been emptied, its contents transferring itself into Yuri’s body. As she was taking notes, Yuri began to feel a light pressure building from within her bladder. She crossed her legs, alleviating the pressure. She didn’t want to go to the bathroom in the middle of a lecture! That would be very rude! Besides, it wasn’t so bad or anything, just a bit noticeable. Once class was over, she would use the restroom.

…or so she thought.

After the class bell rang, she calmly walked towards her favorite girl’s room in the school. However, when she got there, she was in for a rude awakening; the restroom had been blocked off, due to the janitor cleaning it. She was a little peeved, but it was fine. After all, there was always the next period.

Next period came and went, and Yuri started to regret not going to the bathroom earlier. The pressure was really starting to build on her bladder, and she had to continuously cross her legs in her seat to make herself more comfortable. She started growing anxious; was she drawing attention to herself?

After the lecture was over, Yuri made her way to the bathroom again, a little more hurriedly this time. However, to her utter chagrin, the situation looked even worse than before. There were multiple janitors this time, and water was seeping through the bathroom door. Clearly a toilet must’ve broken or something. In spite of her growing discomfort, Yuri shrugged. Well, there was always the home restroom after school. Surely she could wait then.

The next lecture came, and it was Yuri’s least favorite class. She found herself drinking some more water to keep herself from falling asleep. The pressure was building, but she could handle it, right?

Finally, for what felt like eons, the last class ended. Yuri realized she had sucked down the entire bottle for the fourth time in a row. That must’ve been, what, over 2 liters? Yuri could really start feeling the urge now. It was like a bubble filled with water that was increasingly longing to be popped, which would be done once Yuri relieved herself. Yuri tried not to cross her legs anymore during the lecture, as that was rude and attention-seeking behavior, but it was increasingly difficult to.

Yuri made her way over to another restroom, before going to the Literature Club. At this point, she was starting to think she couldn’t hold it until she got home. However, right when she went into the stall, she was greeted by the most disgusting toilet she ever saw. She walked out of the entire restroom. She supposed that it would be a risk she’d be willing to take.

At the literature club, Yuri felt it would be nice to make some tea for everyone. She got the kettle and went to the fountain to make the tea, but as the water continually filled the kettle, it became harder and harder for her to keep her legs uncrossed. Eventually, she had no choice but to cross them, only for a minute, and then she’d be fine. Once the kettle was filled, she went back to the classroom and…

…uh oh.

Yuri suddenly felt a very powerful wave go through her. She set the kettle down, and placed one hand on her crotch. It was really bad this time.

“I don’t need to go…I don’t need to go…” Yuri repeated to herself over and over, desperately trying to keep herself from leaking. Finally, the wave subsided, allowing her to pick the kettle back up and go back into the room.

Reading was such a chore. Not only was Yuri’s urge to pee very distracting, but she didn’t drink any tea, which is something she really liked to do while reading. Despite this, she was determined to prevent herself from looking conspicuous in the club, only crossing her legs to help keep the floodgates from opening. MC was also reading next to her, and the last thing she wanted was to do the “potty dance” while next to him.

“Hey Yuri…” Monika suddenly was right next to her. She jumped in surprise.

“Y-yes!” Yuri replied frantically, startled at her sudden appearance..

“You haven’t been drinking any of your tea. I couldn’t help but notice that. Is everything alright?”

Yuri felt really nervous. Was she really going to tell the president of the club that she is bursting to pee? And right next to MC, no less?!

“A-ah, well…I just…wanted to see what a few pages without tea was like, before going back to having it,” she said. Monika raised an eyebrow, but then shrugged.

“Whatever floats your boat, Yuri.”

Yuri got up and went over to the kettle. Against her bladder’s wishes, she poured herself a cup, and quickly poured it down her throat. Her bladder was already bad. It couldn’t get any worse, right? Plus, the tea was very soothing, and delicious! She could have a couple small cups of tea and still be okay, right?

…

Well, as they continued reading, a “couple” cups of tea turned into three cups, and then four. Then, it went up to ten, and then twenty. Before she knew it, half the kettle was emptied. That was another 850 milliliters! She tried to keep her mind off of her mind-numbing and steadily increasing urge to pee, but at this point it was impossible. Yuri was uncontrollably fidgeting in her seat, hoping against hope that she could find some sort of comfort in her seat, no longer caring if it was impolite or not. She needed to pee, and it was urgent.

“Um…are you okay, Yuri?” MC asked obliviously. Yuri turned to him, her crossed legs continually bobbing up and down.

“I-I’m fine!” She lied. The urge to pee was so powerful that she didn’t think she could get out of her seat anymore without having an accident.

“I don’t know. It looks like you’re really jittery. Did you put extra sugar in the tea or something?”

“Y-yes! That’s it! D-don’t mind me, MC!”

Yuri felt awful. How could she lie to MC like this? Why couldn’t she just tell him that she had desperately needed to pee? She shuddered. Even the thought was too embarrassing for her. There was only ten minutes of reading, and then, say, thirty minutes of reading poems, and then she could go and find the nearest restroom. Could she hold it in that length of time?

Ten minutes went by, but every second felt eternal. Yuri started to uncontrollably clap her thighs together in her seat, as that was the only thing she could do to make herself even slightly more comfortable. Finally, after what felt like ten millennia, the time came for poem reading. Yuri made a sigh of relief. However, just when she was about to get up to start sharing poems, Monika had an announcement.

“Alright everyone! Since everyone was so absorbed into their books, I figured that it would be best if we all read for another hour!”

“Alright! That sounds amazing!” Sayori exclaimed.

“Thank goodness! I was just about to get to the good part of Parfait Girls!” Natsuki sighed, burying her face in the manga (which was definitely literature, let’s not forget).

“That sounds great, Yuri! We can finish the rest of the book now! Isn’t that exciting?” MC asked her. However, when she turned her head towards him, she had the most forced smile she could possibly muster.

“Y-yes…that…sounds great, MC…” Yuri responded through gritted teeth. MC raised an eyebrow, noticing her clenched fists and shaking legs.

“Are…are you okay? You seem…off. It’s not me, is it?”

“N-no! Not at all, MC! It’s…just…” Yuri pondered for a moment about what she should do. On one hand, she didn’t want to waste MC’s time while she went to the restroom, but at the same time…she was practically holding back an entire ocean! If she didn’t pee soon, the fluids would absolutely destroy her clothes. She felt her stomach with her hands, and her eyes widened as she came to the realization that her bladder was much bigger than usual, the enormous amount of fluids screaming at her body to be released in a continuous hot stream.

“N-nevermind. Please, let’s just lay d-down and continue reading,” Yuri finally stated. She slowly lowered her butt onto the hard, smooth tiles, and even this was absolute agony for her bladder. In spite of this, she rested her head on MC’s shoulder, and together they read Portrait of Markov. Her desperation didn’t go away completely, since that was just impossible, but being close to MC actually soothed her desperation somewhat.

Then, they reached the dreaded section of the novel; the part where it goes into great detail about a waterfall for no reason! Yuri knew that she was in trouble, but she moved her eyes left to right, hoping that she could skim through that section quickly. She tried to turn the page, but MC stopped her.

“That was a bit fast, Yuri. I didn’t catch all that.”

“O-okay…” she whispered, cursing herself in her mind. Against her better judgment, she decided to just reread the section. The way the book described the waves crashing against the rocks below, the mist dampening the trees that drooped over the river like a blanket, and so on, was so beautifully descriptive…but it was too descriptive.

Suddenly, Yuri covered her mouth with both of her hands, causing the book to fly out of MC’s hand and making a loud smack on the floor.

“Hey, what was that-”

But before MC could even finish his sentence, he felt his pants suddenly becoming more damp. He quickly got up, and looked down to see a massive puddle completely drenching the floor. His eyes widened as he could see Yuri’s white panties darkening underneath her skirt, and a stream of pee emanating from her crotch. As the stream continued to flow out of her, Yuri’s eyes began to fill with tears, eventually trickling down her cheeks and making her eyes puffy and red.

“I’m sorry…I tried to hold it…it was just too much…drank so much today…couldn’t pee…sorry…” Yuri managed to say through choked breaths, before sobbing completely, laying in a large puddle of her own piss.

“Hey, what’s going on-” Natsuki started to say as she walked over to see what was happening. The other girls did the same, and when they did they were taken aback by what they saw.

“Oh my gosh! Yuri!” Sayori yelped. “What happened?! Are you okay?!”

“She’s sitting in a puddle of her own piss, Sayori! Do you think she’s okay?!” Natsuki retorted. Yuri sobbed even harder at that.

“Oh my! That is…very unfortunate,” Monika muttered under her breath. However, in her mind she said “Good, everything’s going according to plan! Now all that needs to happen is to have MC, and by extension the player, be disgusted by her.”

“Yuri…it’s okay. Please, let’s try to calm down. It’s not that bad-” MC looked down at the puddle, which was now so large that none of them knew where to stand close to her without getting the soles of their shoes wet.

“...Okay, it’s pretty bad, not gonna lie, but-”

Just then, Monika chimed in, interrupting MC with a loud sigh.

“I literally can’t believe this, Yuri! You drenched the entire floor with pee! What are you, 5 years old?”

Yuri’s face, which had already gone red, darkened even more, to the point where it looked indistinguishable from a tomato. She crossed her legs again, covering her crotch with her hands, and attempted to wipe the tears off her face with her shoulder.

“I’m sorry Monika! I’m sorry!” she cried, but Monika held up her hand to silence her.

“Do you have any idea how long it’s going to take to clean all this up? Everyone tomorrow is going to come in and smell your disgusting pee! You should be ashamed of yourself!”

“Monika! Let’s just calm down, okay?” Sayori chimed in. “We’ve all had our moments of having to hold it for a long time. Accidents happen!”

“Don’t make excuses for her, Sayori! If anyone finds out about this, the literature club will be the laughingstock of the whole school!”

“Yeah, but-”

As the argument between Monika and Sayori got worse and worse, MC was wracking his brain on how to fix this situation. He looked down at Yuri, who was drenched in her own pee and continued to bawl. He then looked at Natsuki, who was just staring at Yuri, her jaw hanging open at the sight of her tall, gorgeous purple haired peer sitting in a large puddle of her own making. Clearly she wasn’t going to help with this situation. He then looked at Sayori and Monika. It was clear that he needed to get their attention, but what was he going to do? Was he going to side with Sayori, his best friend, the Vice President of the club and the defender of Yuri, or Monika, the beautiful and authoritative, but strict President of the club who was clearly against Yuri’s accident?

To be continued…

Wow the first chapter was great! As much as I love Monika, I can't help but feel bad for Yuri.

Thank you! I was a bit worried about this chapter, but I'm glad you enjoy it. I hope you'll enjoy the endings when they come out. 😄

I will look forward to the chapters! If Monika had had that power in the game it would have been catastrophic for the others.

}}

Yo, if she had that power, they would all flood the classroom with piss, lmao. She'd be like "See? Everyone is disgusting! Only I'm the one who doesn't piss every five seconds! Now please let me join the real world!" And then she joins the real world and realizes that the player (us) has an omo kink and she's like "...Aw fuck."

The final summary is that it doesn't matter what Monika does, in the end it will never turn out the way she wants. 🤣

Lmao, so true!
