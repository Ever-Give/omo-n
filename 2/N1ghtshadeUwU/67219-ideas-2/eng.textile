OKAY so I found out that the human bladder sends the alert to your brain when it's 3/4 full. BUT if there was a way to have it send the alert when its, say, 1/4 full, would you be desperate for longer? I HOPE THERE'S A WAY TO DO THAT

ALSO can someone make a Mystery Science Theater omorashi please? It's a show about this guy who's stuck in a satellite and forced to watch horrible movies. It's pretty funny, because they make commentary the whole time. He can't control when they start or end, so if he got desperate he would have to wait a while... It you are gonna do this, please do the netflix version... I find it the funniest but idk do what u want
