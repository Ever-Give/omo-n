Looking For Wetting Story

I remember reading a story a while back with a first chapter that included a girl (who was known around her school as "the girl who wet herself") intentionally wetting her pants (I think they were jeans) before leaving to go change, but she revealed her underwear (they may have been purple) to the class because she'd intentionally loosened her belt before she left the room. As she changed into new pants (they may have been brown), she met a girl who made fun of her for wetting herself. Afterwards, she met a guy near the lockers who told her that he found her wettings cute. She dared him to wet himself on the spot, he refused, and she wet the pants that she just changed into before going back into the classroom she'd initially wet herself in. The teacher told her to go change again. The only other thing I remember is that I'm pretty sure the phrase "the size of a dinner plate" was used to describe the size of the wet spot, but that may be wrong.

I've been looking for this story for a while, so I'm wondering if anyone could help me locate it?
