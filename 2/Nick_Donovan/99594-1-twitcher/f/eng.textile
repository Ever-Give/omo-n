Hi, everyone. Well, I finally got it done: my fourth writing piece, and the first one that's wholly original on my end.

Now a quick word of warning. If you've read my previous works, you'll notice there's a lot of... political diatribes going on. Well, this thing is CHOCK full of them, to the point where they might actually make up more of the piece than the proper omorashi-centric content. All at 5,000 words long, mind you. And I believe I've mentioned this before, but I lean considerably more conservative than the vast majority of people here. If that at ALL makes you uncomfortable, this isn't the thing for you. Just click off and go find something else. But if you can stomach it... well... hopefully, you'll at least find it INTERESTING.

And yes: it's a DOCX, not a PDF. No: I'm too lazy/tired to make that change. Just... bear with it, maybe? Please? For me?
