Here we go! As promised: my second writing piece to be uploaded to the site, and my first original work. Well... sort of. This is actually based on a commission I made to FurAffinity user PrismaWielder all the way back in 2019. For those that don't recall it, I've included the associated images as attachments to complement the text. Plus, I actually got this saved as a PDF, so there's no chance for someone to accidentally delete any words. Have a look.
