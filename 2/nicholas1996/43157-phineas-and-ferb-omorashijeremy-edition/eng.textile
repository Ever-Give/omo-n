Jeremy is having a normal day at work at the lemonade stand at the mall when suddenly nature calls,he cant leave the stand for a good 2 hours so he decides to try and hold it,a hour passes and now hes showing signs behind the counter, he cant stop crossing his legs and fidgeting, people ask if hes ok but he keeps lying, by the time its 30 minutes till time to leave hes bursting, he decides to try and sneak a pee and grabs a cup behind the counter, he unzips and sticks it inside and tries to pee while hes pouring a drink so no one notices, but unfortunately Candace notices the smell and looks over the counter and jeremy cant hide it, candace blushes hard having seen whats happening, she tries not to say anything to not give attention to him and just says "ill take care of that cup so the smell doesn't give away what happend" she grabs both her cup of lemonade and the pee cup and throws it away and jeremy blushes hard as it happens.
