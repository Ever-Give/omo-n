This was posted as a request from someone who read my bugs bunny one, it was also posted there but this is for anyone who does not know it is there and are looking for more looney tunes omorshi stories.

Daffy duck is training with speedy at the local track,after a bunch of "training" daffy takes a break and chugs a giant 2 liter of root beer,that was a big mistake,daffy soon gets a urge to pee, he looks at speedy "hey do you think we can stop for a bathroom break?" speedy shakes his head "if you want a chance to beat porky you have to train, train, train, no breaks!" daffy keeps "training" and the urge is growing more and more, he does one lap then looks at speedy with his legs crossed "now can i get a bathroom break?" speedy shakes his head "that was horrible, you need to be able to do a lap in half the time, try again" daffy sighs then does the lap again, daffy really has to go so he is running while trying to cross his legs as well.

He finishes the lap then looks at speedy with his legs crossed hard and fidgeting "come on speedy! i really gotta go, cant i get a small break?", speedy shakes his head "one more lap then you can have a break, your close to being good enough to beat porky in the race" daffy REALLY has to go but he tries his best to do another lap, hes running and taking breaks just to cross and re cross his legs, hes close to bursting, by the time he makes it to the end of the track he looks at speedy and says "bathroom break now?!" speedy sees the desperation in daffy "fine but make it quick" daffy then starts to run toward the bathroom but starts to leak, he looks around and finds a bush near by and rushes towards it, he looks around then lets loose on the bush with a huge sigh "ahhhhhhhhhh thats better" daffy finishes up then goes back to speedy acting like he made it to the bathroom "thanks speedy i needed that"
