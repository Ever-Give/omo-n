This is based off the episode "The cringe" i liked the pee desperation scene and decided to expand upon the idea, i have changed a few things but the idea remains the same.

Its a normal day at school when gumball gets a urge to pee, luckily its after class so he heads to the bathroom but just then the hot dog guy enters the room at the same time,now they both look at each other, there is only one stall so they lock eyes and try to speak but don't know how to ask for the stall without it being embarrassing, just then the bell rings and they snap out of it and then they both say at the same time "oh great now look what you have done, now we have to hold it till after class!", they rush out of the room and head to their own classes.gumball has track and goes outside, it starts to rain as he runs, he groans and starts to walk funny, mean while the hot dog guy is in class he starts to mix chemicals together but the sound is driving him crazy.

He is crossing his legs back and forth, as soon as the bell rings both gumball and the hot dog guy rush to the bathroom and get there at the same time, they lock eyes, gumball begs for the toilet and its clear hes bursting but the hot dog guy is just as desperate,the bell will ring soon when suddenly they feel some come out, they both gasp and rush for the stall, they get in the stall and are squishing each other, they have to go so bad they don't care, and they suddenly just unzip and get them selves out, they don't care that they are exposing each other and then they both give a huge sigh of relief as they share the toilet, it feels amazing as they relive themselves, they finish up then zip up and leave and look at each other and the hot dog guy says "don't you dare tell anyone about this" then gumball says back "i don't plan on it" and they leave just as the bell rings.
