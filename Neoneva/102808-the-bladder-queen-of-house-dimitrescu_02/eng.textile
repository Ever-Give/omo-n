Great to see that there is a new chapter!

One suggestion: The sentence "Just two liters stood between her and the relief ..." was (way) too long IMO.

I would have liked it better if you would have made 3 sentences out of the long one. It felt a little hard to read ðŸ™‚

Yeah thatâ€™s something I always struggle with Iâ€™ll make sure the next chapter is easier to read
